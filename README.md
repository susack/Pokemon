Assumptions made: (due to 4hr time limits)

Used Ang Material auto complete popdown to search all pokemon names. You can start by typing in the names and they will populate all names from the Pokemon API. Types were not added at this time. 

Favorites are made by clicking on checkbox next to item in the Selected Pokemon List and then clicking on Set Favorite button to save items to local storage. This could have be done automatically each time a user selects/deselects an pokemon favorite.

The Clear Local Storage button is just there for convenience and was used as part of my testing. 

Did not flesh out detail page/view for each pokemon image selected. All data on each pokemon from the API is stored in local storage for this name/id poken search
